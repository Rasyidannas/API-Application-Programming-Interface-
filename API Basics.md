# What is API?
API(Aplication Programming Interface) is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components.

# How it works?
1. The Client Makes a Request: The client initiates the conversation by sending a request to the API server.
2. The Server Processes the Request: Once the server receives the request, it deciphers what the client is asking for based on the URL, method, and any data provided
3. The Server Sends a Response: The server then sends a response back to the client.
4. The Client Uses the Response: The client receives the response and interprets the data based on the format specified in the headers.
