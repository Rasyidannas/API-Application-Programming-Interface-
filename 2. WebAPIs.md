# What is Web API
An API is exposed by a web component, allowing other components to interact with it. Web API has a common characteristic "usually request/response based"

## Web API Types
* SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), XML-Based
* REST (Representational State Transfer), JSON-Based
* GraphQL, JSON-Based
* gRPC, Protobuf-Based

## Why REST is not good?
* Fixed Entity Structure
* Request-Response Only
