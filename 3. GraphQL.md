# What is a GraphQL?
GraphQL is an open-source query language for APIs that allows for efficient and flexible data retrieval. GraphQL defines the semantics and components of a GraphQL API. GraphQL has 3 types of operations: retrieve data, write/change data, and subscribe to changes in data.

## How to work with GraphQL
* Defining Schema
* Defining Queries, e.g. 
  ```graphql
  {
    books {
      name
      pages
    }
  }
   ```
* Defining Mutations and Subscriptions (optional)
* Implementing the logic
