# What is a GraphQL?
GraphQL is an open-source query language for APIs that allows for efficient and flexible data retrieval. GraphQL defines the semantics and components of a GraphQL API. GraphQL has 3 types of operations: retrieve data, write/change data, and subscribe to changes in data.

## How to work with GraphQL
* Defining Schema,  
* Defining Queries, e.g. 
  ```graphql
  {
    books {
      name
      pages
    }
  }
   ```
* Defining Mutations and Subscriptions (optional)
* Implementing the logic

## What is the Schema
Schema is for query-specific fields from specific objects :
```graphql
type Query {
  books: [Book!]!
}

type Book {
  bookId: Int!
  name: String!
  pages: Int!
}
```
Schema is used to: define the shapes of data, define queries, define mutations, and define subscriptions.
Schema uses a type system to define: field name, field type, and nullability.
Schema uses Schema Definition Language.

Schema has 2 parts: object type `type Book` and field `{ bookId: Int!}`
Schema field has scalar types: Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID.
The schema field should declare in the Models folder it is related/connected here [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/tree/master/Models)
Sign ! in the field mean field is non-nullable, you can add this sign ? in the Models folder it is related/connected here [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/tree/master/Models).
In the field we can define enumeration type (often abbreviated as Enum). An enumeration type is a type that is restricted to a particular set of values. Check in this [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/blob/master/Models/Book.cs)
