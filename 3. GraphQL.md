# What is a GraphQL?
GraphQL is an open-source query language for APIs that allows for efficient and flexible data retrieval. GraphQL defines the semantics and components of a GraphQL API. GraphQL has 3 types of operations: retrieve data, write/change data, and subscribe to changes in data.  
GraphQL-based system has 2 components: 
* GraphQL Client
* GraphQL Server, exposes the GraphQL endpoint, receives the operations, and returns results. GraphQL Server has the following rules:
    - Define GraphQL Schema
    - Exposes GraphQL Endpoint
    - Validate GraphQL Operations
    - Route GraphQL Operations to Code
    - Return GraphQL Results

## How to work with GraphQL
* Defining Schema,  
* Defining Queries, e.g. 
* Defining Mutations and Subscriptions (optional)
* Implementing the logic

## What is the Schema
Schema is for query-specific fields from specific objects :
```graphql
type Query {
  books: [Book!]!
}

type Book {
  bookId: Int!
  name: String!
  pages: Int!
}
```
Schema is used to: define the shapes of data, define queries, define mutations, and define subscriptions.
Schema uses a type system to define: field name, field type, and nullability.
Schema uses Schema Definition Language.
Schema has 2 parts: object type `type Book` and field `{ bookId: Int!}`

#### Field in Schema
Schema field has scalar types: Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID. The schema field should declare in the Models folder it is related/connected here [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/tree/master/Models). 
Schema has 2 signs: ! in the field mean field is non-nullable, and sign ? in the Models folder it is related/connected here [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/tree/master/Models).  
  
**Kind of Special Schema Field:**
1. In the field we can define enumeration type (often abbreviated as Enum). An enumeration type is a type that is restricted to a particular set of values. Check in this [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/blob/master/Models/Book.cs).
2. Lists is a collection of items of the same type. It's denoted by square brackets [ ]. It is the same as Array. Check in this [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/blob/master/Models/Book.cs)
  
**Structure Object in Scehma**
1. Interface is it defines a set of required and optional fields that an implementing object must include. Check in this [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/blob/master/Models/IReadingMaterials.cs)
2. Unions are similar like Interface but in contrast to the Interface, object types do not have to have common fields or can provide a way to model data more flexible and extensible way. Check in this [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/blob/master/Models/IThings.cs). Example query in Union:
```graphql
{
  things {
    __typename
    ...on Book{
      name
      publishedDate
      reviews {
        rating
      }
    }
    ...on Magazine{
      name
      genre
    }
  }
}
```

## What is the Query
a query is used to retrieve data from the server. It's similar to an SQL SELECT statement or a REST GET request. Example of query:
```graphql
  {
    books {
      name
      pages
    }
  }
   ```
### What is Operation Type?
The operation type is a keyword that defines the kind of operation being performed. There are three operation types: query (for retrieving data), mutation (for modifying data) and subscription (for enable real-time updates).
Example for operation type: 
```graphql
query {
  books {
    name
    pages
  }
}
```
### What is Operation Name?
The operation name is an optional identifier that can be given to a query, mutation, or subscription. Example for operation name: 
```graphql
query GetMyBooks {
  books {
    name
    pages
  }
}
```
### What are Arguments?
Arguments are additional values you can pass to a field or a directive to influence its behavior. Check code in here [GraphQL](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/blob/master/GraphQL/Query.cs). Example for query with arguments:
```graphql
query GetMyBooks {
  books(nameContains: "H") {
    bookId
    name
    genre
    pages
    author {
      authorId
      name
    }
  }
}
```
### What are Variables?
Variables are used to make your queries more dynamic and reusable. Example for query with variable:
```graphql
query GetMyBooks ($bookName: String) {
  books(nameContains: $bookName) {
    bookId
    name
    genre
    pages
    author {
      authorId
      name
    }
  }
}
```
for Variables
```graphql
{
  "bookName": "l"
}
```

### What are Aliases?
Aliases allow you to provide an alternative name for a field in your query. This can be useful when you want to fetch the same data twice but with different fields. Example for query with aliases: 
```graphql
query GetMyBooks {
  booksWithH: books(nameContains: "H") {
    bookId
    name
    genre
  }
  booksWithM: books(nameContains: "M") {
    bookId
    name
    genre
  }
}
```
### What is Fragment?
a reusable piece of code that can be used to specify fields in a query, mutation or subscription. It allows for the sharing of field definitions between multiple parts of a GraphQL query, making the code more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) friendly. Example for query with fragment:
```graphql
query GetMyBooks {
  booksWithH: books(nameContains: "H") {
    ...bookFields
    author {
      name
    }
  }
  booksWithM: books(nameContains: "M") {
    ...bookFields
  }
}

fragment bookFields on Book {
  bookId
  name
  genre
}
```
### What is Directives
Directives are special keywords that provide instructions/conditional statements for executing a query. Currently, 2 directives are part of GraphQL specification:
* `@include (if: Boolean)` - Include the field if the argument is true. Example for query with directive @include:
  ```graphql
  query GetMyBooks ($withAuthor: Boolean!){
    booksWithH: books(nameContains: "H") {
      ...bookFields
      author @include (if: $withAuthor) {
        name
      }
    }
    booksWithM: books(nameContains: "M") {
     ...bookFields
    }
  }

  fragment bookFields on Book {
    bookId
    name
    genre
  }
  ```
  for Variables
  ```graphql
  {
    "withAuthor": false
  }
  ```
* `@skip (if: Boolean)` - Skip the field if the argument is true. Example for query directive @skip:
  ```graphql
  query GetMyBooks ($withAuthor: Boolean!, $noGenre: Boolean!){
    booksWithH: books(nameContains: "H") {
      ...bookFields
      author @include (if: $withAuthor) {
        name
      }
    }
    booksWithM: books(nameContains: "M") {
      ...bookFields
    }
  }
  
  fragment bookFields on Book {
    bookId
    name
    genre @skip (if: $noGenre)
  }
  ```
  for Variables
  ```graphql
  {
    "withAuthor": false,
    "noGenre": true
  }
  ```
### What is Inline Fragment?
A way to include additional fields to an object when the type of the object is not known at the time of writing the query.  It starts with the ... symbol followed by the fragment keyword. Example for query with inline fragment:
```graphql
{
  readingMaterials {
    name
    ...on Book {
      pages
    }
    ...on Magazine {
      issueNo
    }
  }
}
```
### What is Meta Field?
It's often used to provide additional information or metadata about a field in a GraphQL query. Example of meta field is `__typename`

### What is Introspection?
it refers to the ability of a GraphQL schema to query itself. This feature allows for self-documenting APIs and is used for creating tools such as IDEs and GraphQL clients. Example of introspection:
```graphql
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      kind
      description
      fields {
        name
        type {
          name
          kind
          ofType {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This introspection for object 
```graphql
{
  __type (name: "Book") {
    name
    kind
    description
    fields {
      name
      type {
        name
        kind
        ofType {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## What is Mutations
Mutation is a operation that changes the data in your data source, such as a database. It's like the opposite of a query, which only reads data. Mutations in GraphQL allow you to create, update, or delete records in your data source. Example Mutation Syntax:   
```graphql
mutation ($book: BookInput!) {
  addBook(input: $book) {
    bookId
  }
}
```
There 3 main parts in the mutation request: 
* Mutation Object Type, `mutation (...) {...}`
* Mutation Parameters, `... ($book: BookInput) {...}`
* Return Data `... (...) {bookId}`

### What is the Input Type?
The input type is used in the context of mutations to define the data that a client can send to the server to modify or create new data. The input type is defined as an argument to the mutation's field. Similar to queries, input types for mutations can be scalar, enumeration, or complex types such as lists or objects.

### Example Mutations in Real Project
```graphql
mutation ($book: BookInput!) {
  addBook (input: $book){
    bookId
    name
    pages
  }
}
```
For Variables
```graphql
{
  "book": {
    "name": "Rich Dad Poor Dad",
    "pages": 274,
    "genre": "NON_FICTION",
    "price": 14.99
  }
}
```
## What is Subscriptions?
A way to set up real-time data streaming, used when an event is triggered the subscription gets a notification. 
Example of subscription syntax:
```graphql
subscription {
  bookAdded {
    bookId
    name
  }
}
```
There are 3 main parts:
* Subscription object type, `subscription {...}`
* Subscription name, `... { bookAdded {...} }`
* Returned data, `... {... {bookId} }`

### Example Subscription in Real Project
You can check code in here [GraphQL-Demo](https://github.com/Rasyidannas/GraphQL-Demo/commit/52fca6f0e1e127feb501a020de1dd1e5b6c49979)
```graphql
subscription {
  bookAdded {
    bookId
    name    
  }
}
```
